1. "index.html" is the starting point of the project

2. "Menu" is provided on the right hand top-corner of this page which directs to each iteration(weekly progress) 

3. "Part 1" represents week 1's progress and so on.

4.  Created a 3d object i.e "House" which can viewed on the "Part 2" page by clicking the button provided.
 
6.  Applied 3d tranformations to the model (scaling,rotation,transformation).

7. The parameters chosen for the transformation are: (ox,oy,oz) point looked at, (ry,ry,rz) rotation angles, ar aspect ratio, s scaling, d distance between observer and projection screen, f far plane Z coordinate, n near plane Z coordinate

8. Implemented Perspective projection

Impress Me: Showed a 3d model of the house using "modal" on the page
	    Improved User Interface
